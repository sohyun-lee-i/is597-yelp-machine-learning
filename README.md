# is597-yelp-machine-learning

The IS597 Yelp Machine Learning file contains the code needed to reproduce my project. You will need to unzip the attached yelp_filtered_dataset before running the notebook.

The Setup-Yelp Filtering file is provided to show how I created the yelp_filtered_dataset file from the larger Yelp dataset. You do not need to run this notebook; it's there as reference.
